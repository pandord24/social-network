# social-network

## Description

An API for a social network web application where user can share their thoughts, react to friends' thought, and create friend list.


- My motivation is to learn more about Express.js and Mongoose.
- I built this project to improve my code writing skill. 
- By applying proper syntax with Express.js, it is more organized and easily to identify problems. 
- I learned ways to structure Express.js and Mongoose.
